				<h2>About Cyllearnic</h2>
			</div>
			<div className="info-container">
				<p>
					Cyllearnic was created by a very small team of developers aiming to
					build a unique, all-in-one Cyrllic learning tool.
				</p>
				<p>
					The creators of this web application do not speak any of the offered
					languages. We created it to aid our own learning and support others in
					doing the same. We believe Cyllearnic provides learners with a fast
					and accessible way to compare and contrast different Cyrllic alphabets
					and discover which one suits them best.
				</p>
				<p>
					Whether you're here to gain a foundational knowledge of one of these
					languages, enrich your travels, or want to gain a deeper understanding
					of the rich literature, culture, and history of the countries
					represented here, welcome and enjoy!
				</p>
				<p>
					Development of this application began in Q2 of 2025. It is in active
					development with various phases planned to continually add new
					features, full device responsiveness, and additonal alphabets.
				</p>
				<p>
					As noted in the footer of every page, this project is focused on
					helping users learn and appreciate the diversity of Cyrillic alphabets
					and the cultures that use them. All countries, languages, and cultures
					are approached with respect and neutrality.
